# Predicting_News_Popularity

The increasing importance and availability of the internet in the 21st century has made it the primary source of new consumption via websites and social media platforms. 
News popularity, commonly measured by reads, likes, or shares, is a vital metric in ranking articles for stakeholders like content providers, advertisers, and news agencies. 

Accurately predicting popularity is thus vital for news sites, as it has financial implications in terms of advertising spend, income, and subscriptions that flow towards their websites.
This project used three machine learning models and the random forest algorithm, with an accuracy rate of 66.8% and an AOC score of 0.663, which was selected as the best to be implemented
